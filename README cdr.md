# cdr's Path of Exile 2 filters

https://ko-fi.com/cdrkf => My ko-fi, like patreon

Currently two: 

> **cdr-endgame.filter**, for all endgame content, eg waystone tier 1 - tier 15+.

~80% feature parity with NeverSink Path of Exile 1 filter.
- All known PoE2 items explicity handled by name.
- Economy tiering for all currency, uniques, etc.
-   NOTE: As there are no API data sources, eco tiering updated infrequently if at all.
- Progression for waystones, uncut gems, etc.
- Tiering of all bases.

Currently almost nothing is hidden, besides non-best normal/magic bases.

You're encouraged to edit to your own liking.

HIDE THINGS AT YOUR OWN RISK. Tiering is not perfect and values can change quickly.

> **cdr-end-strict.filter**, for true endgame farming, waystone tier 15+ only.

Most things worth less than ~1ex average are hidden. Non-jewellery bases are hidden. Non-best rares are hidden.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. Available in the release source zip or GitHub source above.
